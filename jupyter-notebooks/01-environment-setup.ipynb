    "# Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines a number of steps designed to get you up and running with the **nanobind** library, which allows for calling of C++ code from Python for C++17 and newer (and Python 3.8 and newer). It is assumed that you are using Linux, with the commands `git`, `cmake` and `g++` being available (similar invocations should work under Windows, possibly with Git-Bash installed, or MacOS, however this has not been tested).\n",
    "\n",
    "If using this tutorial in Jupyter notebook format, running each code cell in this notebook in turn should be sufficient to fully install and test **nanobind** (and optionally the C++ **Eigen** library for matrix Math computations), all under the location of the directory in which `jupyter lab` was run (ideally the same writable directory as the notebooks themselves).\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, the installation should be persistent across sessions (at least for locally-hosted JupyterLab/Notebook), so subsequent notebooks can be followed, or returned to at a later time, without further reference to this one. The code for this tutorial is based upon that from http://nanobind.readthedocs.io/ and reference to this documentation for a more detailed treatment is recommended once the environment is set up.\n",
